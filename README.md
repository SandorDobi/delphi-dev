# delphi-dev — Claude Code Plugin

> A Delphi development toolkit optimized for AI usage. Turns any AI assistant into a senior Delphi expert.

---

## What is it

**delphi-dev** activates automatically whenever Claude Code detects Delphi-related content — `.pas`, `.dpr`, `.dfm`, `.dpk`, `.dproj` files, or any mention of Object Pascal, FireMonkey, VCL, FireDAC, or RAD Studio. Once active, Claude applies the full Delphi Style Guide, Clean Code principles, and SOLID patterns without being asked.

---

## Features

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| **Auto Delphi Mode** | Opening any `.pas`, `.dpr` or `.dfm` file activates the full coding standards context automatically |
| **`/audit`** | Generates a complete professional technical audit with per-dimension scoring and a prioritized modernization roadmap |
| **`/review`** | Quick code review — detects violations and provides corrected examples |
| **`/write`** | Writes new code with all standards applied from the start |
| **`/new-project`** | Scaffolds a new project with standardized layered folder structure |
| **`/spec`** | Analyzes the current project source code and auto-generates a complete `SPEC.md` |
| **`/tdd`** | Generates a complete DUnitX unit test suite for the project |
| **`/about`** | Displays plugin info, version, and available commands |

---

## Installation

**In Claude Code (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.):**
```bash
/plugin marketplace add adrianosantostreina/delphi-dev
/plugin install delphi-dev@delphi-dev
```

**Via terminal (CLI):**
```bash
claude plugin marketplace add adrianosantostreina/delphi-dev
claude plugin install delphi-dev@delphi-dev
```

### After installation

After running the install command, a menu will appear asking for the installation scope:

| Option | When to use |
|---|---|
| **Install for you (user scope)** | Recommended for individual developers — available in all projects on your machine |
| **Install for all collaborators (project scope)** | Adds the plugin to `.claude/settings.json` so everyone who clones the repo gets it |
| **Install for you, in this repo only (local scope)** | Available only in the current project, gitignored |

> **Note:** After confirming the installation in the menu, the plugin will be installed silently — no confirmation message is shown.

**Verify the installed version:**
```
/about
```
The current version should be **1.3.0**.

> **Tip (Windows):** If you get a "Host key verification failed" error, run this once in your terminal before installing:
> ```powershell
> git config --global url."https://github.com/".insteadOf git@github.com:
> ```

### Updating

To update to the latest version, uninstall and reinstall:
```bash
/plugin uninstall delphi-dev
/plugin install delphi-dev@delphi-dev
```

### Uninstalling

```bash
/plugin uninstall delphi-dev
/plugin marketplace remove delphi-dev
```

Or via CLI:
```bash
claude plugin uninstall delphi-dev
claude plugin marketplace remove delphi-dev
```

## Standards Applied Automatically

### Prefixes
- `F` — fields (private attributes)
- `A` — method parameters
- `L` — local variables
- `C_` — constants (+ UPPER_CASE body)
- `T` — classes and types
- `I` — interfaces
- `E` — exceptions

### Formatting
- ✅ 2-space indentation (no tabs)
- ✅ 120-character line limit
- ✅ `begin` and `else` on their own lines
- ✅ One variable per line
- ✅ One unit per line in `uses` clause (RTL → VCL/FMX → FireDAC → Third-party → Project)

### Prohibited Commands
- ❌ `with` — causes ambiguity and debugging issues
- ❌ `Break` / `Continue` — use loop conditions instead
- ❌ `Real` — use `Double` or `Currency`
- ⚠️ `Exit` — allowed only as guard clauses at the top of a method

### Safety Rules
- ✅ One resource per `try..finally` block
- ✅ No empty `except` blocks
- ✅ SQL always parameterized (no string concatenation)
- ✅ `const` never applied to interface parameters (ARC compatibility)
- ✅ No global variables — use `class var` instead

### Component Prefixes (VCL / FMX)
`btn`, `edt`, `lbl`, `mmo`, `cbx`, `grd`, `qry`, `cnn`, `dts`, `pnl`, `tmr`, and more — see [`skills/delphi-standards/references/component-prefixes.md`](skills/delphi-standards/references/component-prefixes.md)
